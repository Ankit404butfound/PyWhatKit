### Code Formatting

Please make sure that your code follows the PEP8 standards and that you provide proper type hinting for the functions and parameters.
We will soon be adding a new workflow to format the code according to PEP8 but till the time you can use the `autopep8` library to do so.
1. Install `autopep8` using `pip3 install autopep8`.
2. Run `autopep8 -i filename`, replace the filename with the name of the file you want to format.
3. Save and commit your changes.
