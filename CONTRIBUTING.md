# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing!. All types of contributions are valuable. üìù

Please make sure to read the documentation before making your contribution! It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers to make the most of it and smooth out the experience for all involved. üíö

## If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something

* Open an Issue [here](https://github.com/Ankit404butfound/PyWhatKit/issues)
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Provide project and platform versions (python, pip etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Head over to [this page](https://pywhatkit.herokuapp.com/request-feature)
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're looking for.
* If you want to contribute that feature yourself, please open a new draft PR [here](https://github.com/Ankit404butfound/PyWhatKit/pulls).

## Code Formatting

Please make sure that your code follows the PEP8 standards and that you provide proper type hinting for the functions and parameters along with proper spacing.
You can follow [this](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html) guide on how to integrate black formatter with various IDE's and Editors.

For VSCode users, create a `.vscode` folder in the project directory and a `settings.json` file inside it.
Inside the file add the following lines:

```json
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.python"
}
```

You can also use `black filename` in the terminal to format each file separately.

**Make sure to use pre-commit with `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing your changes.**

## Adding New Features

Here are some few things to keep in mind before working on a new feature:

* We really want this library to be lightweight so please don't add features with heavy dependencies.
* Keep the features relevant to the library.
* Before adding a new feature, open up an Issue to discuss it or ping any mods on discord.
